Tic Tac Toe assignment for 8th Light.

To run, please follow the steps for one of the options below:

##Option 1 - Importing Eclipse Project from Git##
1. Create a new Eclipse workspace.
2. In the top menu, click on "File" -> "Import".
3. In the dialog that appears, expand the "Git" node.
4. Select "Projects from Git" and click "Next".
5. Select "Existing local repository" and click "Next".
6. Click "Add".
7. In the "Search criteria" section, click "Browse", and select the directory in which the cloned project is contained.
8. In the "Search results" section, the Git project should have appeared.
9. Click on "Finish".
10. Click on the selected Git project and click "Next".
11. Make sure the "Import existing projects" radio button and top most node (should say "Working Directory") are selected.  By default, these should have already been selected.
12. Click "Next".
13. Click "Finish".
14. The TicTacToe project should have been successfully imported.
15. Navigate to the package, "deliverymechanism.main".  Under this package, open the TicTacToeDriver.java file.
16. Click the Run button.  The program should have successfully executed.

##Option 2 - Run the included jar file in terminal or command prompt##
If you are running a Mac, in the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the TicTacToe.jar file.
Run the following command: java -jar TicTacToe.jar

If you are running Windows, the steps are the same as the above except you'd be using the command prompt instead of the terminal.
