TicTacToe
=========

Tic Tac Toe assignment for 8th Light.

To run, please follow the steps using one of the options below:

##Option 1 - Importing Eclipse Project from Git##
1. Create a new Eclipse workspace.
2. In the top menu, click on "File" -> "Import".
3. In the dialog that appears, expand the "Git" node.
4. Select "Projects from Git" and click "Next".
5. Select "Existing local repository" and click "Next".
6. Click "Add".
7. In the "Search criteria" section, click "Browse", and select the directory in which the cloned project is contained.
8. In the "Search results" section, the Git project should have appeared.
9. Click on "Finish".
10. Click on the selected Git project and click "Next".
11. Make sure the "Import existing projects" radio button and top most node (should say "Working Directory") are selected.  By default, these should have already been selected.
12. Click "Next".
13. Click "Finish".
14. The TicTacToe project should have been successfully imported.
15. Navigate to the package, "deliverymechanism.main".  Under this package, open the TicTacToeDriver.java file.
16. Click the Run button.  The program should have successfully executed.

##Option 2 - Run the included jar file in terminal or command prompt##
This option requires the Java platform (JDK) to be installed.  To verify that this is so, open the terminal or command prompt, and type in the following: "java -version".  If the resulting message indicates that it is not installed (i.e. something not found or not installed), please visit Oracle's website [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), and download (as of 1/5/2015) Java Platform (JDK) 8u25.  Follow the install instructions, and when that is complete, re-open the terminal or command prompt, and type in "java -version" again.  It should now display the version number and a couple other related information.

If you are running a Mac, in the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the TicTacToe.jar file.
Run the following command: java -jar TicTacToe.jar

If you are running Windows, the steps are the same as the above except you'd be using the command prompt instead of the terminal.
